I am a Ph.D. student in the Ecology & Evolution program at Rutgers University under Dr. Lena Struwe. My research focuses on mutualistic interactions of endophytic bacteria in bryophytes. Currently, I am studying bacteria present within the oil bodies of some liverwort species.

Otherwise, I am also a field bryologist for the NJDEP, where I focus on making species lists to document the bryophyte flora of New Jersey. In this capacity I have rediscovered several historical species that have not been documented in the state for over 100 years, as well as some new species that have never been documented in the state. 

I spend most of my time looking at bryophytes and algae. I am interested in how microbial interactions with bryophytes can inform the nature of plant-microbe interactions in early land plants, as well as evolutionary trends and taxonomy of bryophytes. I'm familiar with temperate bryophytes, and to a lesser extent Lichens, Desmids, and Cyanobacteria. I am very familiar with my favorite groups, the Polytrichaceae, Fissidentaceae, Frullaniaceae and Lejeuneaceae.
